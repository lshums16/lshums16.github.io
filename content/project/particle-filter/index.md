# To use, place an image named `featured.jpg/png` in your page's folder.
# Otherwise, specify the `filename` option to load an image from your `assets/media/` folder.
# Placement options: 1 = Full column width, 2 = Out-set, 3 = Screen-width
# Focal point options: Smart, Center, TopLeft, Top, TopRight, Left, Right, BottomLeft, Bottom, BottomRight
# Set `preview_only` to `true` to just use the image for thumbnails.

As part of a class project, I implemented an online particle filter localization algorithm in simulation for a robot moving through an environment represented by a pre-known occupancy grid map. The simulated robot was equipped with a noisy laser range finder.

To maintain academic integrity, my implementation of this method is kept private in a Github repository. This project involved skills in:

- State estimation
- Probability theory
- Dynamic systems
- Python
